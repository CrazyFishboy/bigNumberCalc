# bigNumberCalc
c++ implementation for working with numbers larger than possible in the supported integer types.

Still in development...

Will utilize a dynamically allocated array of integers in order to store extremely large numbers.
In theory, it will be able to store a number of 2^64 -1 digits in length.
